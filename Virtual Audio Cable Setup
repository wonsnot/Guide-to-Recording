I highly recommend paying for the full virtual audio cable package. This guide is geared toward having 3 Virtual Audio Cables.

• Download and install all of the virtual audio cables, then restart.
• Set your default "speakers" to the first VAC and rename it to Desktop Audio if you like
• Set your Discord/Teamspeak audio to VAC A and rename to Coms
• Go to your recording devices and set Desktop Audio and Coms to be listened to on Cable B (Rename to Mix Out).
• Set Mix Out to be listened to on your headphones.
